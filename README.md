# 📊 Seaborn Data Visualization – Penguins Dataset

## 📌 Overview

This project summarizes my learning of **Seaborn** for data visualization using the built-in **Penguins dataset**. It focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distribution, relationships, and patterns through different plots.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* Python
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* NumPy

## 📂 Dataset

The Penguins dataset was loaded directly from Seaborn using `sns.load_dataset("penguins")`. It includes features such as species, island, bill measurements, flipper length, body mass, and sex.

## 📈 What I Learned

* **Scatter & Line Plots:** Analyzed relationships and trends between numerical variables using `hue`, `style`, and `palette`.
* **Histograms & KDE Plots:** Studied data distributions and density patterns.
* **Strip, Swarm & Violin Plots:** Compared body mass across species and islands while understanding data spread and density.
* **Box & Bar Plots:** Interpreted statistical summaries like median, IQR, and variance.
* **Count Plot:** Visualized frequency of categorical variables.
* **Joint Plots:** Combined scatter plots with histograms/KDE for deeper insights.
* **Heatmap:** Visualized correlations between numerical features.
* **PairPlot & PairGrid:** Explored relationships among all numeric variables efficiently.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

This project helped me understand how to choose the right visualization for different data types, improve EDA skills, and effectively communicate insights using Seaborn.

## 🚀 Conclusion

Overall, this project strengthened my foundation in **data visualization with Seaborn** and improved my ability to analyze and interpret real-world datasets visually.
